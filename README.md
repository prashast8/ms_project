Title: Non Interest Income, Asset Quality Review'2015 and Indian Bank Performance

A healthy financial credit lending system is the backbone of any developing economy. Banks 
are the most important source of credit in the current financial system of the world. 
The government of India announced a huge bank-merger plan in August’19 owing to the 
decreasing health of the balance sheets and increased pressure faced by these banks. The plan 
came into effect on 1st April, 2020 when ten public sector banks merged into four public 
sector banks reducing the number from 27 in 2017 to just 12 in 2020.

But what led to the finance ministry to take such bold steps? A clear answer is the 
deteriorating health of the PSB’s balance sheets. The health of a bank is nothing but the risk 
inherent in the loan portfolio of a bank i.e. the lower the probability of a bank’s asset turning 
in to a non performing asset, the healthier and stronger the bank. Hence higher the asset 
quality of a bank, lower is the credit risk of the loan portfolio and lower is the probability of a 
bank asset turning into NPA.

In this report, the major focus has been on the credit risk of Indian Banks and the after effects 
of the Asset Quality Review (AQR) carried out in July, 2015 which revealed that many banks 
in India were hiding the true health of their balance sheets. Two major exercises have been 
carried out on Indian banks to have a brief understanding of current financial scenario.

The main focus of these exercises is to get a general idea of asset quality of Indian banks and 
to look at their profitability post AQR period. It has been found that non-interest income 
activities have not been deteriorating the asset quality of banks. Moreover, weak evidence has 
also been found regarding decreasing profitability of banks after the AQR in 2015.
